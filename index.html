                    and also see if the problem I faced exists beyond just me. In the process of developing the first prototype using react.js.

            <h3>Project 1: Dynamic Lift Experiment</h3>
            <p> This is a research project I have been working on at the College of Engineering at UW-Madison 
                under Professor Robert Radwin and PhD student Zihao Zhu. <br> 
                This project aims to analyze daily labor movements and optimize posture and movements in order to maximize output in high-movement 
                jobs. I have worked collaboratively on different datasets and have prepared and processed over 25TB of data which is to be trained through 
                a model provided by Lightbuzz. I am currently working on training the AI motion-based model.<br>

                <h4>Key Learning:</h4>
                <p><i>The primary objective of this project was to acquire insights into motion-based and posture tracking, as well 
                    as to deepen my understanding of Lightbuzz. The essence of this project closely mirrored that of 
                    PostureX, making it crucial to gain valuable experience from more experienced individuals in the field.

            <p>The Stock Inventory and Role Assignment desktop app is designed to help local apartment managers efficiently
                 manage their inventory and assign roles to staff members. I contributed to this project by designing the 
                 application's architecture, developing the core functionality using Flutter, and setting up the initial data 
                 integration. The project was built using Flutter for its cross-platform capabilities, with Visual Studio and 
                 Visual Studio Code as the primary development environments.</p>
            <h4>Key Learning:</h4>
            <p><i>
                This project was my first venture into both front-end and back-end development, incorporating a real-time client and 
                providing a comprehensive experience similar to real-world development scenarios. This invaluable experience has 
                equipped me well for future endeavors. Additionally, it introduced me to Flutter, an excellent UI development tool 
                that I had not previously encountered.

            <h3>Project 3: Teeko AI</h3>
            <p>I developed a Python-based implementation of the Teeko game, integrating an AI player using a minimax 
                algorithm with heuristic evaluation for optimal move selection. This project simulates the classic 
                board game, allowing for an engaging player vs. AI experience. The AI evaluates potential moves up 
                to a specified depth to ensure competitive gameplay. The project was built using Python, leveraging 
                libraries such as NumPy for efficient state comparison and game logic implementation.</p>

                <p><i>
                    This project provided me with valuable insights into AI-based game development. With AI growing exponentially, 
                    both this project and the corresponding "Intro to AI" course have prepared me well to explore these concepts
