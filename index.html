                tabs seamlessly using NFC technology for quick check-ins and payments. Built with Kotlin for the front end 
                and Firestore for real-time backend support, it ensures to update deals and menus for individual clients. Customers avoid long 
                waits, while bars benefit from faster service and increased sales. The app’s cashless, contactless approach 
                enhances convenience, making it the ultimate smart tab management solution for bars, restaurants, and 
                nightlife venues.

            <p> Currently working on Mixdup, a music collaboration platform, is an open-source platform designed for musicians to collaborate on music projects using a 
                workflow inspired by GitHub. Users can create repositories (songs), open issues (tasks), fork projects, submit collab 
                requests (pull requests), and track contributions with version control. The frontend is being built with React, providing 
                a dynamic and responsive user experience, while Supabase will be used to power the backend, database 
                management, and file storage for seamless collaboration. This system enables musicians to work on tracks 
                efficiently, track changes, and attribute contributions, making remote music production structured, transparent, 
                and community-driven.

                <h4>Key Learning:</h4>
                <p><i>TThrough this project, I seek to have gained deeper insights into version-controlled collaboration for music production,

                This project aims to analyze daily labor movements and optimize posture and movements in order to maximize output in high-movement 
                jobs. I have worked collaboratively on different datasets and have prepared and processed over 25TB of data which is to be trained through 
                a model provided by Lightbuzz. I am currently working on training the AI motion-based model.<br>

                <h4>Key Learning:</h4>
